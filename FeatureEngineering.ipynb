Data used can be increased by considering the final clickout in the other cities besides the final city.  \n","More data will be generated by seperating the one session the number of subsessions in case the session contains more than one clickout in different cities, and will be treated as totally different sessions for the same user."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"v69U4HIGKMAw","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Mounting to Drive"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"qKOJSxSSKU2s","colab_type":"code","outputId":"d17e75b5-83cb-4359-e17c-3fe3bad5d465","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1588372764386,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":420,"user":{"displayName":"Zeyad Mahmoud Sabbah","photoUrl":"","userId":"01004994567431397755"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":54}},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","%cd /content/drive/My Drive/Trivago/Project/TrivagoRecommenderSystem"],"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive;
